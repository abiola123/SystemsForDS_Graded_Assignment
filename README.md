# Systems for Data Science Graded Assignment

This programming assignment was part of the evaluation for the CS-449 Systems for DS course @ EPFL.


## 1. Matrix Multiplication with Map-Reduce
In this exercise, we were asked to implement a Matrix Multiplication Algorithm using only Map-Reduce concepts. 

This means that this algorithm can then be used and parallelized with Spark or other Map-Reduce Frameworks

## 2. Creation of a simple peer-to-peer network
In this exercise, we were asked to create a Large Scale Efficient Peer To Peer Network, where users are able to store data on other nodes and retrieve data given the key without knowing where the data is stored.

We were also asked to provide some kind of replication for saved files in case some of the nodes fail.

The whole exercise was solved in Scala
